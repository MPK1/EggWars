# EggWars
A spigot plugin by RosilloGames based on the mini game "EggWars" from CubeCraft Games:
* EggWars is a team/solo PVP game where players have to protect their egg, while gathering tokens from generators to purchase items from the shop to eliminate other teams. If your egg is destroyed, you won't respawn on death!

This restored version was created in 2019 using as base the now lost EggWars plugin by gaelitoelquesito for Minecraft 1.8 to 1.11.2, and it has been improved with further customizability and upgraded to support Minecraft 1.16 to 1.19.4.

## Developer notes
- In order to properly set up this project in your IDE, you will need to import all the libraries bundled in the spigot jar
- Java version is 1.8
